# GAMEPLAN: Fix Prescription Pause/Unpause Schedule Bug

## Problem Statement (@priority-0)
**Bug**: If a prescription has been paused and unpaused, it doesn't show up in the schedule correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigating the codebase, I identified this as a **cache invalidation issue**:

### Current Architecture
- **Schedule Page** (`/frontend/src/pages/Schedule.tsx`): Uses React Query with key `['active-prescriptions']`
- **Prescriptions Page** (`/frontend/src/pages/Prescriptions.tsx`): Uses React Query with key `['prescriptions']`

### The Problem
1. When a prescription is paused/unpaused in the Prescriptions page
2. Only the `['prescriptions']` cache is invalidated
3. The `['active-prescriptions']` cache remains stale
4. Schedule page continues showing outdated data until manually refreshed

### Evidence
- `deactivateMutation.onSuccess` only invalidates `['prescriptions']`
- `reactivateMutation.onSuccess` only invalidates `['prescriptions']`
- Schedule page fetches data independently with different query key

## Solution
**Fix**: Add cross-cache invalidation to ensure Schedule page gets fresh data when prescriptions are modified.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Update `deactivateMutation.onSuccess`** in `Prescriptions.tsx`:
   - Add invalidation for `['active-prescriptions']` cache
   - Maintain existing `['prescriptions']` invalidation

2. **Update `reactivateMutation.onSuccess`** in `Prescriptions.tsx`:
   - Add invalidation for `['active-prescriptions']` cache
   - Maintain existing `['prescriptions']` invalidation

### Files to Modify
- `/frontend/src/pages/Prescriptions.tsx`

## Testing Plan

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Deactivating a prescription immediately removes it from the schedule
- [ ] Reactivating a prescription immediately shows it in the schedule
- [ ] Navigation between Prescriptions and Schedule pages shows consistent data
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality

### Test Steps
1. **Setup**: Ensure application is running with test data
2. **Test Deactivation**:
   - Go to Prescriptions page
   - Deactivate an active prescription
   - Navigate to Schedule page
   - Verify prescription is NOT shown in schedule
3. **Test Reactivation**:
   - Go back to Prescriptions page
   - Reactivate the prescription
   - Navigate to Schedule page
   - Verify prescription IS shown in schedule
4. **Test Navigation**:
   - Navigate between pages multiple times
   - Verify data consistency

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` in frontend directory
- [ ] Run `npm run typecheck` in frontend directory
- [ ] Ensure no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Verify no console errors in browser

## Benefits
- ✅ **Immediate UI consistency** across pages
- ✅ **No manual refresh needed** by users
- ✅ **Maintains existing architecture** - minimal changes
- ✅ **Low risk** - targeted fix addressing root cause
- ✅ **Improved user experience** - real-time updates

## Implementation Status
- [x] Problem identified and root cause analyzed
- [x] Solution designed
- [x] Code changes implemented
- [x] Testing completed
- [x] Quality checks passed

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### Code Changes Made
**File**: `/frontend/src/pages/Prescriptions.tsx`

1. **Updated `deactivateMutation.onSuccess`** (lines 37-39):
   - Added `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['active-prescriptions']);`
   - Maintains existing `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['prescriptions']);`

2. **Updated `reactivateMutation.onSuccess`** (lines 49-51):
   - Added `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['active-prescriptions']);`
   - Maintains existing `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['prescriptions']);`

### Quality Assurance Results
- ✅ **ESLint**: No linting errors
- ✅ **TypeScript**: No type errors
- ✅ **Build**: Successful compilation
- ✅ **Application**: Running successfully on Docker

### Fix Summary
The bug where paused/unpaused prescriptions didn't show up correctly in the schedule has been **resolved**. The Schedule page will now immediately reflect changes when prescriptions are activated or deactivated from the Prescriptions page, eliminating the need for manual page refreshes.

This fix ensures real-time consistency between the Prescriptions and Schedule pages, providing users with an immediate and accurate view of their active medication schedules.
