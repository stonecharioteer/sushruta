## Workflow Memories

- Always update claude.md before making changes so that you can track what you're doing in case you run out of tokens.
- Always update claude.md, and readme.md
- Always use hadolint to lint dockerfiles, and if you know any other linter for docker-compose, use that.
- IMPORTANT you MUST use linters and formatters for all code.
- IMPORTANT always save the gameplan to claude.md so you can resume from it.
- IMPORTANT YOU MUST RUN LINTERS TO SEE IF THE CODE IS RIGHT BEFORE YOU COMMIT.
